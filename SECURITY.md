## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the mittwald CLI,
please reach out privately via email to security@mittwald.de instead of opening
a public issue. Please do not disclose the vulnerability until we have had a
chance to address it.

When reporting a security issue, please include a description of the location
and potential impact of the vulnerability, and a detailed description of the
steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.
